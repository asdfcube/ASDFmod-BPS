# ASDFmod-BPS
## Client Side Block Placing Sound Mod _by asdfcube_
### Background
If you have high ping on some servers and play Minecraft, you would probably notice that the sounds for placing blocks are delayed.<br>
Mojang has bigbrain and decided to make those sound server-side, meaning that if the server never tells your client to play them, they will never be played.<br>
This is especially annoying when you have high ping and play minigames that place blocks like Bedwars. For me personally, I speedbridge by listening to the block sounds, so I created this mod to help whoever with high ping.
<br>
### The Mod
This mod is designed to be lite and has as little impact on the game as possible.<br>
And it is so small that all codes can be fit into [one singular file](src/main/java/asdf/mod/BPS/BPS.java).<br>
You will need at least Java 8 and must be Minecraft Forge 1.8.9.
<br>
### Download/Building & Installation
Just go to [Releases](https://github.com/asdfcube/ASDFmod-BPS/releases) and download the `asdfbps-1.jar` in Assest tab.<br>
~~Although it will probably never get updated because there is nothing to update.~~<br>
<br>
If you are a nerd and want to compile it yourself, just clone this repository, then run<br>
`./gradew build` if you are on Windows;<br>
`gradew build` if you are on macOS or Linux.<br>
The built mod jar will be in the `build/libs` folder, with name asdfbps-1.jar<br>
<br>
To install, just move the mod file into your mods folder in `.minecraft` like every other mod.<br>
### Bugs Reporting
Coding Minecraft mods is always amazing, because you never know what stupid mistake Mojang made can crash your mod, so far before the release I have not encountered any bugs, but if you do, please report it by [creating an issue](https://github.com/asdfcube/ASDFmod-BPS/issues/new).
